I belive that the new law that prevents usage of cellular devices in school is unsafe, and that it is a bad look on the state for enforcing it. People need their phones for possible translation and language assistance, and incase of emergencys phones are needed to contact guardians about problems that could be occuring in the school.

I am interested in Architectual Engineering, computer science could be helpful in calculating equations and helping determine if the structure I would create is functional and will withstand different enviornments.

My idea to use AI is to create a Self-Improvement application that could help certain indivisuals who would like to get their life back on track, wether that is to read more or eat better, work out or talk to people. These activites could be calculated by AI to figure out what best suits your need in that desired moment. all you will need to do is tell the AI what your problem is and what is going on in your life and it will pull itel from different websites that could assist you. Doing this just makes reserch easier and more direct of an answer instead of needing to search manualy for fake non credible sites that may or may not give you the information you are searching for.

I belive that working in a vitual store could have its ups and downs, like you dont need to get dressed in the morning and spend money on gasoline, but on the otherhand it could shutdown at any moment. These problems that people face with virtual stores are common, people could shut your whole website/application down and it will not be a reliable source of income rather than an in person store that people can go to at any time. They know exactly the products they are paying for rather than a product that just has good reviews from different people who cannot be reliable. So my answer to the prompt is no, artificial store will not be viable to last in this economy as on this momment.

The phrase "67" is a viral, nonsensical meme, often spoken playfully to signal shared digital culture. It functions as a collective inside joke, intentionally confusing older people and amplifying its fun. This repeating behavior is a joyful, low-stakes rebellion against a lack of understanding. It comes from a 2024 rap song, “Doot Doot (67)”. For those in on it, meaninglessness is the point.

If i were to be incharge of a school, my AI policy wouldnt be strict at all, because AI is a thing people use every day to solve their problems, the world has adapted to the modern times but yet the schools still stick to the same ways of teaching for years even with all the advancement in technology. So if i was to be the person who determines what is allowed in school i would say that students are able to use AI to assist them in their studies just as adults would use it in their every day life.
